# Python-for-Everybody

Hello, 

this repository is all the codes I did during the Python for Everybody class in FreeCodeCamp by Dr. Charles R. Severance.
According to his class my codes are complete and functional.
You might see a lot of #comments which might get confusing but that's just how I learn to understand the code.

Feel free to let me know if you have any questions. :)

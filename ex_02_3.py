# Exercise 4: Assume that we execute the following assignment statements:
# width = 17
# height = 12.0
# For each of the following expressions, write the value of the expression and the type (of the value of the expression).

width = 17
height = 12.0

a = width//2
print(a)

b = width/2.0
print(b)

c = height/3
print(c)

d = width + height * 5
print(d)
